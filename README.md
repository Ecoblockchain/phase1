OMG Threat Modeling Phase1
======

Synopsis: Repository for Phase 1 of OMG Threat Modeling (Cyber Domain PIM, STIX and NIEM PSM)

This is the repository for the first phase of the OMG Threat Modeling effort. The overall goal for this effort is to create a semantically consisten threat meta model that can be used to federate between different threat sharing standards, and enable a vibrant threat sharing ecosystem. 

For the first phase, we will focus on creating a conceptual threat model (that can be mapped to a Cyber Domain PIM, that is conformant with the UML Profile for NIEM), and will generate both NIEM-compliant schemas and STIX artifacts. Enabling a mapping between these established information sharing systems will create a baseline for the the broader threat meta model. 

Most of the work will be conducted through an OMG email list: threat-modeling@omg.org. For questions, please contact request@omg.org. 

The current Meeting Schedule is here: https://github.com/omg-threat-modeling/phase1/wiki

Also, please check out Project Interoperatbility at http://project-interoperability.github.io/. This project is spearheaded by PM-ISE to improve overall interoperability for information shareing.
