OMG Threat Modeling Phase1
======

NEWS: 


The Object Management Group (omg.org) in collaboration with government, industry and academic organizations has initiated a standards activity for an operational threat and risk model (AKA Ontology) intended to federate multiple formats, technologies and use cases to enable a fusion of information in support of proactive and reactive threat/risk assessment, analytics, mitigation and information sharing. The focus of this effort is fusion of threat and risk information across physical, criminal and cyber concerns. Some of the data structures we are federating include the STIX, NIEM and CAP standards.

As an OMG standards effort a team has formed to respond to this RFP with a specification for a proposed standard. This repository provides tghe foundation for the evolving specification.

The specific RFP is available here: 
http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc.cgi?sysa/2014-6-17

The workgroup meets each week and at OMG meetings. This submission team is reaching out to industry experts to participate, particularly vendors, researchers and organizations with critical threat/risk needs. Please contact us if you are interested in joining us.

Most of the work will be conducted through an OMG email list: threat-modeling@omg.org. For questions, please contact request@omg.org. 

Our team artifacts are located on github, here:
